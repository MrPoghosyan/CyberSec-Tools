# Cybersecurity Toolkit

## Description
This repository serves as a toolkit for cybersecurity, containing various projects aimed at network security, log analysis, and automation of security-related tasks. The projects here are written in C++ and Python, focusing on practical applications for threat detection, log processing, and network scanning.

## Repository Structure
- **C++-Projects**: Includes security-related projects written in C++.
  - **Network Scanner**: A project to scan a network and identify open ports.
  - *(Other C++ projects to come)*
  
- **Python-Projects**: Contains automation and analysis tools written in Python.
  - **Log Analysis**: A Python script for analyzing system logs and detecting potential security incidents.
  - *(Other Python projects to come)*

## Project Examples

Each project includes its own `README.md` file with details on usage and functionality. Here are a few examples of what's currently available:

- **Network Scanner (C++)**: A program that scans networks to identify open ports, providing a basis for understanding network vulnerabilities.
- **Log Analysis (Python)**: A script that processes system logs to detect suspicious activity, which can indicate security threats like unauthorized access attempts.
